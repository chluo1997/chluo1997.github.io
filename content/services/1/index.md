I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Software Security and System Lab](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cqian/s3.html) at the University of Hong Kong. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Meng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~wei/), and received my B.Eng. from Wuhan University.

My research interests primarily include web security, program analysis, and software security. Recently, I have mainly worked on developing techniques for automatically detecting and patching vulnerabilities in software (C/C++ and Web applications).

I will join the [Institute for Math & AI](https://imai.whu.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in January 2025.
