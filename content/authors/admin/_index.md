I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Institute for Math & AI](https://imai.whu.edu.cn/index.htm) and [School of Cyber Science and Engineering(国家网络安全学院)](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the [System Security](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cqian/) at HKU. I received my Ph.D. from the Chinese University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Meng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~wei/) and received my B.Eng. from Wuhan University.

My research focuses on program analysis and software security.  I prioritize analyzing and addressing **security problems with real-world implications**. My first- and corresponding-author papers have discovered over 100 high-severity security vulnerabilities in real-world software infrastructure such as Chrome and OpenSSL. These efforts have been recognized with vulnerability bounty awards exceeding *200,000* USD from major companies such as Google.

<span style="color: red;">I am actively seeking <strong>highly motivated</strong> Ph.D. and master’s students. If you are interested in security and have experience through CTF or security research, please feel free to reach out to me.</span>
