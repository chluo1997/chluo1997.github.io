I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Software Security and System Lab](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cqian/s3.html) at the University of Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Chenxiong Qian](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cqian/). I received my Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I was supervised by [Prof. Wei Meng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~wei/), and received my B.Eng. from Wuhan University.

My research interests primarily lie in software security and program analysis. Recently, I mainly worked on developing techniques for automatically detecting and patching vulnerabilities in software. My main-author works have discovered and fixed more than one hundred of high severity security vulnerabilities (overflow and arbitrary write) in important software infrastructure including OpenSSL, Poppler, and V8. 

I will join the [Institute for Math & AI](https://imai.whu.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in January 2025. <span style="color: red;">I am looking for <strong>highly motivated</strong> Ph.D. and master students. If you have an interest or experience in security (through CTF or security research), feel free to contact me. </span>
